# Compression in Serialization

The purpose of this example is to show the typical compression ratios for text data.
This can be used to estimate when serialization benefits from compression.

## Running the example

The example is stored as an IPython notebook.
To render the notebook, you can use the Jupyter Lab environment.
The following uses [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to install and run the environment locally.

```shell
poetry install
poetry run jupyter notebook compression.ipynb
```
